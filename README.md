**Simulator To WordScapes**

In this project we will create the console-based simulator of the wordscapes games, where the user is given some letters and the user has to guess the words from those letters.

●       This game is designed for only 5 levels.

●       At each level the user will be given some letters and the user has to guess 5 words to move to the next level.

●       If the user guesses the wrong word at any chance, the user will lose one live point and will be asked to give another word.

●       The user will get 5 lives which means the user can make 5 wrong guesses.

●       After 5 wrong guesses the game will automatically get over and the user will get the final score.

●       But if the user makes correct 5 guesses, they will move to the next level.

●       At the end of each level the user will be asked if the user wants to continue or not.

●       If the user selects yes, the game will continue but if the user selects no then the game will stop at that level and the final score will be displayed.
